## ‚≠ê Abstract

Although Deepfake technology holds promise in media and entertainment, its malicious use for fraud and defamation poses serious threats to social stability and public trust. Most existing Deepfake detection methods rely heavily on extensive labeled training data, which is costly and resourceintensive to acquire. Moreover, existing unsupervised detection approaches suffer from feature-decision decoupling, limiting their generalization capability. To address these fundamental limitations, we propose a unified unsupervised framework named PGDD-Net, which integrates feature learning with geometric decision-making without requiring labeled data. First, we design a novel pseudo-label generation method based on visual artifact features that provides reliable supervisory signals for unlabeled training samples. Then, we propose a Prototype-Guided Contrastive Learning (PGCL) that enhances discriminative capability through momentum-updated class prototypes, which promotes intra-class compactness and enhances inter-class separability for effective feature learning. Finally, we design Dual Deep Support Vector Data Description (Dual-DeepSVDD) to effectively integrate discriminative feature learning and geometric decisionmaking by constructing dual hyperspheres for real and fake samples. The effectiveness of the method is validated on four benchmark datasets, including FF++, DFDC, DFR, and CelebDF. Extensive experimental results show that the method achieves the best performance among unsupervised methods while remaining competitive with supervised approaches, demonstrating its potential for practical applications.
